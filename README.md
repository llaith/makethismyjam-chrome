jamlet
======

**Jamlet** is a little extension that lets you change your current jam on [This Is My Jam] based on the contents of your current tab in Chrome.

If you're browsing on any of the following pages (more services coming soon!):

* A SoundCloud track page
* A YouTube video page
* A Hype Machine track page
* A Bandcamp-powered track page
* A direct MP3 link


â€¦then a "JAM" icon will appear in your URL bar. 

Click it to go directly to the jam preview / customisation screen on This Is My Jam, bypassing that pesky search etc. Sweet!


*Conceived by [Matthew Ogle] on the train to [Music Hack Day Scotland], 24 August 2012. This could be much better, care to help?*
